What is this repo all about?
This repository is to share my coding accomplishments and summarize what Ops 201 is all about.

Why are you learning these skills?
These skills will not only help me get a job in the Information Technology field, but will also give me the tools and skills to further my understanding of today's computers, as well as give me a better understanding of how to protect myself online.

What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
I learned the basics of Command Prompt, Powershell and Linux Terminal and how to find/do different important and informational tasks through them. I learned the basic fundamentals of Python (though still learning), and how to do a Loop, Array, Robocopy to name a few.

What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
All the Ops challenges had their struggles, whether it was system issues (Limitations of the Lab PC) or user errors. My favorite challenge was one of the simplest challenges which was Ops 13 (Whois challenge). The commands in this challenge were so easy but so important to gain information about the user and directories and opened my eyes to the possibilities of how basic information from something like this can lead to pretty big cyber security risks.

How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
Putting everything that we learned together for this, shell scripting can be very useful for patching, automation, file management, user management and so much more.

What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
Automation scripts

What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
In reality I want to improve my overall knowledge on scripting because there is a lot to learn and I am not good at it, but for this question, I want to improve the understanding of the symbols (. / {} [] etc.) and why they function in scripting
